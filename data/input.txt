{"prompt": "Extract data\nPage: Method 2 \u2013 Alternative Progress Payments Table to Section 40 of the Act FORM 1 Regulation 12(a) WARNING TO OWNER\u2014CHANGE OF LEGAL RIGHTS Section 40 of the Domestic Building Contracts Act 1995 provides that a builder cannot charge more than a fixed percentage of the total contract price at the completion of each stage of building a home. The Act also allows the parties to a contract to agree in writing to change the stages and the percentage of the contract price to be paid at the completion of each stage. There are several ways in which a particular contract can vary from the normal, and it is these exceptional cases which have caused the law to allow for these changes. Examples would include: \u2022 where it is very expensive to prepare the land for building for example, where the site is steep or rocky; \u2022 where the house is so large that it will take a long time to complete, and intermediate progress payments are therefore required; \u2022 where exceptionally expensive finishes are required, meaning that the final stage will represent a much larger proportion of the whole price; \u2022 where an architect is engaged to independently assess the value of completed work for progress payments. You should not agree to progress payments different from that provided in the Act unless your house is unusual in some way and you are SURE THAT DIFFERENT PROGRESS PAYMENTS ARE NECESSARY and you understand clearly why the change is needed in the case of your particular house.

BUILDER\u2019S LICENCE 17.1. The Owner grants the Builder a licence to exclusive possession and occupation of the Land to construct the Works until the Builder has received all monies payable for the Final Claim. 17.2. The Builder may allow persons required to deal with the Builder access to the Land in relation to the Works including without limitation: sub-contractors; suppliers and employees; or agents of the Builder. 17.3. The Owner warrants and indemni\ufb01es the Builder where the Builder is unable to obtain access to adjoining properties to the Land where access is required for the construction of the Works. If the Builder cannot reasonably access the Land for the construction of the Works, then the Contract will be deemed frustrated and the Builder is entitled to terminate the Contract. WARNING! The Owner shall ensure that the adjoining neighbours consent to their property being accessed if access is necessary for the construction of the Works. If the ! Owner is uncertain whether access is required, this shall be discussed with the Builder before signing the Contract. 18. OWNER\u2019S ACCESS TO LAND 18.1. The Owner, or a person authorised by the Owner, will be granted reasonable access to the Land to view any part of the Works, subject to the Owner or the Owner\u2019s agent after giving the Builder notice. 18.2. A person who is exercising a right of access granted under this clause must not interfere with the construction of the Works, including without limitation giving directions or instructions to sub-contractors; suppliers; and employees or agents of the Builder. WARNING! The Owner is not permitted to access the Land without the consent of the Builder. Access to the Land without the Builder\u2019s supervision is a serious breach of ! the Builder\u2019s work health and safety insurance policy and can seriously disrupt the progression of the Works. 18.3. The Builder is not liable for any costs or delays that result from a breach of clause 18.2 where the Builder noti\ufb01es the Owner in writing within \ufb01ve (5) Business Days of the breach occurring. Clause 18.3 is a cost escalation clause.
